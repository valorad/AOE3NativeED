# Dependencies
This folder is intended to work directly with the extracted xml(xmb)s from the original bar files.

And this folder is not under git version control. 

Use [Resource-Manager](https://github.com/VladTheJunior/Resource-Manager) to extract the xml files from the .bar files, and also use it to pack them back.

## .bar files needed to extract and later re-pack

Art:
- Art.bar

Data:
- Data.bar

Sound:
- Sound.bar

## Note
Turn out you don't really need a .bar file to make the mod work. You just need to place your mod with the xml files into local mods folder under directory `User/Games/Age of Empires 3 DE/[ID]/mods/local/`
